# Notes and Ideas

What sort of theme?    Use the original etchaskecth theme?

Or a Bob Ross theme?  
Happy little trees?   Pixel trees?  Pixel landscape?  How?

Or some other artist theme?


(Optional Objective): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.

How to make it so that I can click and dragon the workspace instead of hover.
