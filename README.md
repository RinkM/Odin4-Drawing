# Odin4-Drawing


## Assignment is found here :
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch
Basically, create an Etch-A-Sketch like app which allows the user to draw on the screen.

## Learning Objectives 
* Manipulate the DOM using Javascript.
* Practice using event listeners.
* Practice loops (for, while)
* Use buttons to alter the program.
* Make a wicked drawing of an airplane.



### Notes For Self : 

(Optional Objective): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.

How to make it so that I can click and dragon the workspace instead of hover.
